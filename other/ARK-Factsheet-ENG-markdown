##1. What is ARK?
ARK is an ecosystem, not just a cryptocurrency. The ARK platform is built on a highly secure core
friendly platform to increase user adoption of blockchain technology.

Initial supply | 125.000.000 ARK
---|---|----
Block time | 8 seconds
Transactions per block | 50 transactions
Payload | SmartBridge data field on transactions (64 characters)
Block reward | 2 ARK + Fees
Active forging delegates | 51 Delegates
Node implementation | nodejs, postgres
Website | https://ark.io
Subreddit | r/ ArkEcosystem 

##2. Decisive Arguments

* Fast

The 8-second block times makes ARK's network one of the fastest in the industry. Delegated Proof of
Stake allows adaptation of blocksize and other parameters to stay fast under increased usage.

* Decentralized

These delegates are tasked with running the network and are rewarded with block rewards, much
like miners in Bitcoin. Additional relay nodes strengthen the network and ensure worldwide
accessibility and consensus.

* Scalable

The primary goal with ARK is to keep the core blockchain lean and blazing fast. The SmartBridge
functionality makes it possible to off-load non-essential functions to hundreds of side-chains.


* Collaborative

ARK is a truly global effort with a lot of core team members from all over the world and an evergrowing
population of hardcore dedicated community developers, ARK is a collaborative effort in the
true sense of the word.

* Bridging

ARK connects well known blockchains through the use of our custom SmartBridge technology,
making an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains possible.

* Open Source

The Ark Ecosystem and projects are completely open-source to help facilitate needs and to launch a
SmartBridge compatible blockchain. Everything is hosted on GitHub for your ease and convenience.

* Business Entity

Ark registered a business entity in France called Ark Ecosystem and is working with the French
government to ensure legal compliance.


##3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

DPoS uses a real time voting system to decide who is allowed to create new blocks. DPoS leverages
the power of stakeholder approval through voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and
democratic way. All the network parameters like for example fees or block size can be decided on by
elected delegates.


##4. Delegates
Everyone can run a node of the ARK network. You become a delegate by registering your account
with a transaction and entering your passphrase into your relay node to activate forging. The 51
delegates with the highest number of votes can forge new ARK blocks. The delegates get the
transaction fees and the block reward for including transactions in new blocks. The delegates can use
these funds as they wish but a lot of delegates share most of it with their voters. You can check the
current delegates statistics and the ranking on: https://explorer.ark.io/delegateMonitor

###4.1. Voting For a Delegate
1. Install the latest Ark Desktop Client or Mobile Wallet
2. Create an account
3. Store your passphrase
4. Backup your passphrase
5. Confirm your passphrase
6. Withdraw ARK from an exchange
7. Start the voting process: Click VOTES
8. Add your delegate by selecting the delegate username and clicking ADD DELEGATE
9. Register your vote, click VOTE
10. Sign vote transaction with passphrase by entering your secured passphrase from point 3
11. Accept the fee
12. Check your vote transaction

**You are responsible for checking the details of delegate structure, reward, and any other specifics before committing your vote.** Delegate proposals can be found in:

##8. ARK Features & Vision
###8.1 SmartBridge
ARK communicates between the blockchains using a special data section called Smartbridge and
special Encoded Listener nodes that comb through this data for tasks that it can perform. A
mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging function built into ARK Core. Any
blockchain can send and receive trigger function notices and informational data through the primary
ARK network via custom developed SmartBridges and Encoded Listeners. The Encoded listener node
is a hub for listening to SmartBridge transactions. This transaction hub can be setup and run by
anyone that wants to act as a medium to help the network. For providing this service, they will be
collecting transaction fees for passing data or exchanging currencies via SmartBridge.
###8.2 Push Button Deployment
Push Button Development makes it possible to customize and create a new blockchain and token
within a few mouse clicks. Making ARK clone-able with push button deployment and linked to ARK's
Main Chain via SmartBridge. Any startup that wants to fork ARK can do so with ease and be
SmartBridge compatible right out of the box.
###8.3 ARK Virtual Machine (ArkVM)
ArkVM is about solid Smart Contracts in a highly scalable environment with low fees. The ARK Virtual
Machine integration will allow users to issue ARK Smart Contracts, which is similar to Ethereum.
###8.4 ARK Core Version 2
The ARK node code is getting a total overhaul. The core will be rewritten from scratch. This means for
ARK, a faster transaction throughput, higher scalability, dynamic fees, use of multiple cores, quicker
transaction processing, better stability, multiple payment transactions, preparations for smart
contract deployments and tons of other new features.
###8.5 Programming Interfaces (APIs)
ARK is built on node.js/javascript but it can be used by most programming languages. There are
multiple programming languages allowing most developer communities to access and use the ARK
blockchain. ARK offers the following programming interfaces/languages:

* Java
* Python
* C
* C++
* R
* Go
* TypeScript
* Elixir
* RPC
* Lua
* .Net
* Advanced PowerShell
* Rust
* Kotlin
* PHP/Laravel
* Nucleid
* Ruby
* Swift iOS
