## Decisive Arguments
- **Fast**: The 8-second block times makes ARK's network one of the fastest in the industry. Delegated Proof of Stake allows adaptation of block size and other parameters to stay fast under increased usage.
- **Decentralized**: These delegates are tasked with running the network and are rewarded with block rewards, much like miners in Bitcoin. Additional relay nodes strengthen the network and ensure worldwide accessibility and consensus.
- **Scalable**: The primary goal with ARK is to keep the core blockchain lean and blazing fast. The SmartBridge functionality makes it possible to off-load non-essential functions to hundreds of side-chains. 
- **Collaborative**: ARK is a truly global effort with a lot of core team members from all over the world and an ever-growing population of hardcore dedicated community developers, ARK is a collaborative effort in the true sense of the word.
- **Bridging**: ARK connects well known blockchains using our custom SmartBridge technology, making an ecosystem of interconnected blockchains possible.
- **Open Source**: The Ark Ecosystem and projects are completely open-source to help facilitate needs and to launch a SmartBridge compatible blockchain. Everything is hosted on GitHub for your ease and convenience.
- **Business Entity**: Ark registered a business entity in France called Ark Ecosystem and is working with the French government to ensure legal compliance.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
DPoS uses a real time voting system to decide who can create new blocks. DPoS leverages the power of stakeholder approval through voting to resolve consensus issues in a fair and democratic way. All the network parameters like for example fees or block size can be decided on by elected delegates.

## Delegates
Everyone can run a node of the ARK network. You become a delegate by registering your account with a transaction and entering your passphrase into your relay node to activate forging. The 51 delegates with the highest number of votes can forge new ARK blocks. The delegates get the transaction fees and the block reward for including transactions in new blocks. The delegates can use these funds as they wish but a lot of delegates share most of it with their voters.

## ARK Features & Vision

###	SmartBridge
ARK communicates between the blockchains using a special data section called Smartbridge and special Encoded Listener nodes that comb through this data for tasks that it can perform.  A mechanism to bridge together blockchains is provided via a bridging function built into ARK Core. Any blockchain can send and receive trigger function notices and informational data through the primary ARK network via custom developed SmartBridges and Encoded Listeners.  The Encoded listener node is a hub for listening to SmartBridge transactions. This transaction hub can be setup and run by anyone that wants to act as a medium to help the network. For providing this service, they will be collecting transaction fees for passing data or exchanging currencies via SmartBridge.

###	Push Button Deployment
Push Button Development makes it possible to customize and create a new blockchain and token within a few mouse clicks. Making ARK clone-able with push button deployment and linked to ARK's Main Chain via SmartBridge. Any startup that wants to fork ARK can do so with ease and be SmartBridge compatible right out of the box.

###	ARK Virtual Machine (ArkVM)
ArkVM is about solid Smart Contracts in a highly scalable environment with low fees. The ARK Virtual Machine integration will allow users to issue ARK Smart Contracts, which is like Ethereum.

###	ARK Core Version 2
The ARK node code is getting a total overhaul. The core will be rewritten from scratch. This means for ARK, a faster transaction throughput, higher scalability, dynamic fees, use of multiple cores, quicker transaction processing, better stability, multiple payment transactions, preparations for smart contract deployments and tons of other new features.

###	Programming Interfaces (APIs)
ARK is built on node.js/javascript but it can be used by most programming languages. There are multiple programming languages allowing most developer communities to access and use the ARK blockchain. ARK offers the following programming interfaces: Python, Elixir, RPC, Lua, Java, .Net, R, C, Go,Advanced PowerShell, Rust, Kotlin, PHP/Laravel, TypeScript, C++, Nucleid, Ruby, Swift iOS

##	Delegate Jarunik 

###	Introduction and Skills
I am proposing myself as delegate under the nickname Jarunik to expand and diversify the Ark ecosystem. I have a master in economics and information technology. I worked as Software Engineer, Software Architect and in management roles completing a lot of successful development projects. I have a deep technical background combined with an excellent economic understanding. I am involved in the technical side of the financial industry since more than 10 years. I bring an extremely good mix of skills which help me to successfully run a delegate.

###	My Proposal
My proposal is focusing on a trustworthy relationship with my voters. I am transparent with all I do and post regular updates about my various contributions. I rely on good word of mouth marketing and good references from voters. Most delegates try to promise and offer better and better profit sharing rates. Looking at the resulting payment history you will notice that there is no big difference in rewards. Therefore, I focus on supporting the community with contributions. If you still wonder about the reward share you can check the recent payment history on my website <https://arkcoin.net>.

###	Projects and Services
I take care of several tasks daily:
- Reddit moderation /r/ArkEcosystem, /r/ArkDelegates and /r/arktrader
- More projects on: <https://www.reddit.com/r/DelegateJarunik/wiki/projects>

I offer the following main services and consider developing more:
- Voter Bounty Program
- Escrow Service

I also provide a lot of information:

- <https://medium.com/@jarunik>
- <https://arkcoin.net>
- <https://twitter.com/jarunik>

###	My Network Setup
I run my Virtual Private Servers (VPS) with excellent infrastructure and support. I choose reliable VPS providers and choose servers with excellent specifications.

###	Conclusion
I am convinced that my time is well spent on developing Ark for the benefit of the entire community. If you want to support me please give me your vote. Thank you!
